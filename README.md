## 🏗️ Architecture

### **Security-First Design Pattern**
```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   API Gateway   │ -> │  Rate Limiter    │ -> │ Authentication  │
│ (Entry Point)   │    │ (Smart/Adaptive) │    │   & Security    │
└─────────────────┘    └──────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
           │                       │                       │
           v                       v                       v
┌─────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│ Business Logic  │ <- │ Risk Assessment  │ <- │  Audit Logger   │
│   (Core API)    │    │    Engine        │    │ (Security Events) │
└─────────────────┘    └──────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```
